# Introduction

So for people asking wtf is $SOLS - here you go:

Understanding the fair launch (first is first) meta powered by

inscriptions and why it's taking over solana.

Hint: it's because it gives everyone a chance

- this concept was imported from ordinal communities

- the idea here is that a "deployer" sets the rules for the memecoin (name, ticker, max amount, etc)

- they then mint and inscribe the deployment inscription (example: 20,000 supply at order number 150,000)

- everyone now mints and inscribes on their own following the format of the rules, typical there is no minting and inscribing cost (aside from rent), so its essentially free

- a validator now checks if your inscriptions are above 150,000 order and fits within the first 20,000 correct coins inscribed then you are in

- a hashlist is generated from valid inscriptions and sent to marketplaces and can now be traded as regular verified NFTs

- $SOLS was the first successful SPL20 coin deployment launch

- this whole concept can not only be used for memecoins but also for fair launch NFT projects

No presales to the secret cabal of solana, no WL to your favorite 1/1 projects, no airdrops to influencers, no none of that.

First is first, completely fair, free for all launch meta.
