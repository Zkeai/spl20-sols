<p>So for people asking wtf is $SOLS - here you go:</p>
<p>Understanding the fair launch (first is first) meta powered by
<a href="https://twitter.com/LibrePlex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@LibrePlex<ExternalLinkIcon/></a></p>
<p>inscriptions and why it's taking over solana.</p>
<p>Hint: it's because it gives everyone a chance</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this concept was imported from ordinal communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the idea here is that a &quot;deployer&quot; sets the rules for the memecoin (name, ticker, max amount, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they then mint and inscribe the deployment inscription (example: 20,000 supply at order number 150,000)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone now mints and inscribes on their own following the format of the rules, typical there is no minting and inscribing cost (aside from rent), so its essentially free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a validator now checks if your inscriptions are above 150,000 order and fits within the first 20,000 correct coins inscribed then you are in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a hashlist is generated from valid inscriptions and sent to marketplaces and can now be traded as regular verified NFTs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$SOLS was the first successful SPL20 coin deployment launch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this whole concept can not only be used for memecoins but also for fair launch NFT projects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No presales to the secret cabal of solana, no WL to your favorite 1/1 projects, no airdrops to influencers, no none of that.</p>
<p>First is first, completely fair, free for all launch meta.</p>
